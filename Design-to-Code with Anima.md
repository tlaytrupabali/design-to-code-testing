# Design-to-Code conversion with Anima

### Introduction:

Anima is a **design-to-code** plug-in / platform for Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch.
It lets designers create fully responsive prototypes that look and work exactly like the finished product, which then can be translated into developer-friendly code.

Developers can navigate through the entire design code and make any changes they want. They can also verify any changes on the same workspace as Anima displays a graphical representation of the programming code.

> *Anima is working on projects to offer new code conversion options to Swift, ReactNative, and Angular.*

### Features:

- Get the code for a **specific component** or download the **full code package** for use in your personal framework.
- Open the generated code in **CodeSandbox**.
- **Built-in effects** - parallax scroll animation, dropdown menus, hover effects, screen loading animations, videos, and more.
- **Smart Styleguide** - Anima detects all the colors and text styles that appear multiple times in your design and automatically generates a Styleguide written in CSS.
- **Real-time preview** or do a **Code-based** and **live prototype testing** in every screen size while making adjustments, adding breakpoints etc.
- **Publish your website** directly from Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to a domain for testing, pre-production or production.
- **Real-Time collaboration** with comments and **live drafts**.
- Chrome extension for **one click design-to-code**.
- **Reusable components with component variants**.
- **Auto-Flexbox**.
- **Material Design** - a library based on the latest Google guidelines consisting of interactive building block elements like: Buttons, Checkboxes, Drop-downs, FABs, Google Font Icons, Radio Buttons, Sliders, Switches, and Text Fields.

> *Developer claims that Anima is the only platform that offers truly functioning Material Designs that are live, responsive and can be automatically translated to their corresponding codes.*

- **React** can be exported with *Plain CSS, Styled Components* or *Sass(beta) styling* options and *Functions or Classes-based syntax* options.

### Pricing:

- Free plan - 0$.
- Pro - 39$ per month or 31$ if paid yearly.
- Business - 117$ per month or 93$ if paid yearly.

### My experience:

Unfortunately I was unable to export any code as the free plan allows for one project to be created and none to be exported. What I’ve found out is that for the purpose of checking the quality of the code, you can preview the code of a project on Anima’s platform and then understand how it’s written, without being able to copy or export it.
